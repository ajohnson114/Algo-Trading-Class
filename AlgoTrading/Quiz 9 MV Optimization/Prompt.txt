For our analysis, we use the data found in multi asset xlsx.
The time-series data gives monthly returns for the 11 asset classes from mid-2009 to mid-2021.
We will be working with the risky MV frontier for 11 risky asset classes, and we will use the excess-return formulation and frontier. The data you are provided has already subtracted short- term treasury returns, (a measure of the risk-free rate.) So go ahead and use these returns as excess returns on risky
 

Summary Statistics
 

Calculate and display the mean and volatility of each asset’s excess (Recall we use volatility to refer to standard deviation.)
Which assets have the best and worst Sharpe ratios?
 

The MV frontier
Compute and display the weights of the tangency portfolios: wtan.
Compute the mean, volatility, and Sharpe ratio for the tangency portfolio corresponding to wtan.
 

The allocation
Compute and display the weights of MV portfolios with target returns of µp = 0.0075 (
This is monthly data, so while this target looks small, it is reasonable.)

What is the mean, volatility, and Sharpe ratio for wp?
Discuss the In which assets is the portfolio most long? And short?
Does this line up with which assets have the strongest Sharpe ratios?
 

Long-short positions
 

Consider an allocation between only domestic and foreign (Drop all other return columns and recompute wp for µp = .0075.)
Is the portfolio balanced?
Make an adjustment to µforeign equities of +0.002. Recompute wp for µp = .0075 for these two assets
How does the allocation among the two assets change?

Does this two-asset example raise any issues for the 11-asset problem about the statistical precision of the MV solutions?
 


Robustness
Recalculate the full allocation, again with the unadjusted µforeign equities and again for µp = 0. This time, make one change: in building wtan, do not use Σ as given in the formulas in the lecture. Rather, use a diaganolized ΣD, which zeroes out all non-diagonal elements of the full covariance matrix, Σ.
How does the allocation look now?

What does this suggest about the sensitivity of the solution to estimated means and esti- mated covariances?
HMC deals with this sensitivity by using explicit constraints on the allocation Con- ceptually, what are the pros/cons of doing that versus modifying the formula with ΣD?
Out-of-Sample Performance
Let’s divide the sample to both compute a portfolio  and  then  check  its  performance  out  of sample.

 

Using only data through the end of 2018, compute wp for µp = .0075, allocating to all 11
Calculate the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio within that sample, through the end of
Calculate the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio based on performance in 2019-2021.
How does this out-of-sample Sharpe compare to the 2009-2018 performance of a portfolio optimized to µp using 2009-2018 data?
Robust Out-of-Sample Performance
Recalculate wp on 2009-2018 data using the diaganolized covariance matrix, ΣD. What is the performance of this portfolio in 2019-2021? Does it do better out of of sample than the portfolio constructed on 2009-2018 data using the full covariance matrix?
